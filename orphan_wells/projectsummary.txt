What we don’t know: 

We do not know when an oil or gas well will become an orphan, and we do not know which features in orphan well datasets are the best predictors of these patterns when integrated into machine learning models. Current orphan well databases also can be merged together and organized into a consistent format. 

What problem we will solve:

The problem is that we want to combine all RRC data and then analyze it to determine which well characteristics contribute most to the time it takes the well to become orphaned.

How we will solve it:

We will solve this problem by building up a database with PostgreSQL and predicting on the data with machine learning methods including but not limited to regression, ensemble methods, and neural networks. The target feature could be the amount of time that has passed from when the well was first drilled to when it was abandoned, and the features used for prediction could include the oil prices over that time period, the oil field, district, and geospatial data of the well, the operator for the well, and the name of the lease.
