There are times when companies decide to abandon certain oil rigs, which is classified as orphaning it.
This becomes a problem as the wells need to be dealt with properly, undergoing a process known as plugging
and abandoning which can be costly. In this project I aim to develop a reinforcement learning algorithm that,
when specified, can minimize financial, environmental, or time loss. It should be able to do so while
accounting for changes in oil price and other subsequent changes in variables.
