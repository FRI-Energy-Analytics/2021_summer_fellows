      The problem is that we can’t currently predict well log data more 
than a few feet away from the tool while drilling. Our problem is to 
create a system that can predict well log data much further with much 
less initial data or potentially no initial data. To do this we will use 
a set of transformers for the prediction along with an accompanying neural 
network to pick the best transformer for the current well. 
Note: we might be able to use k-means clustering or something similar instead of a neural net.
